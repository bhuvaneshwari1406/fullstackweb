     <h1><a name="1.what is coronavirus?">1.what is coronavirus?</a> </h1>
     <p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are known to cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle 
     East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).</p>

     <h1><a name="2.What is a novel coronavirus?">2.What is a novel coronavirus?</a> </h1>
     <p>A novel coronavirus (CoV) is a new strain of coronavirus that has not been previously identified in humans.</p>

     <h1><a name="3.Can humans become infected with a novel coronavirus of animal source?">3. Can humans become infected 
         with a novel coronavirus of animal source </a> </h1>
     <p>Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans in China in 2002 and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have
          not yet infected humans. As surveillance improves around the world, more coronaviruses are likely to be identified.</p>

     <h1><a name="4.What are the symptoms of someone infected with a coronavirus?">4. What are the symptoms of someone 
         infected with a coronavirus?</a> </h1>
    <p>It depends on the virus, but common signs include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, 
        infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.</p>

    <h1><a name="5.Can coronaviruses be transmitted from person to person?">5. Can coronaviruses be transmitted from person to person?</a> </h1>
   <p>Yes, some coronaviruses can be transmitted from person to person, usually after close contact with an infected patient, for
        example, in a household workplace, or health care centre.</p>

   <h1><a name="6.What can I do to protect myself?">6.What can I do to protect myself?</a> </h1>
   <p>Standard recommendations to reduce exposure to and transmission of a range of illnesses include maintaining basic hand and respiratory hygiene, and safe food practices 
        and avoiding close contact, when possible, with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.</p>

   <h1><a name="7.Why is the sky blue?">7.Why is the sky blue?</a></h1>
   <p>The earth is surrounded by an atmosphere.The atmosphere (i.e., air, one of the four elements) is a mixture of gasses, mostly nitrogen and oxygen.The way the
     sun’s light travels through the atmosphere makes the sky look blue. White light is made of several different colors, like you see in a rainbow. Each of these colors travel in a wave, but the wavelength (distance between the tops of each wave) varies. Red light has a long wavelength, while blue light has a much shorter wavelength.
    wavelengths of colored lightWhen light from the sun enters our atmosphere, the waves collide with gas molecules. The longer wavelengths, like red and yellow, pass straight through and appear to us as “regular” sunlight.
    Shorter wavelengths, like blue, bump into the gas molecules and scatter in different directions. Some of it still makes it through directly, but the rest is reflected back to our eyes from all directions, so the whole sky looks blue.
     Use a slinky to demonstrate wave-length motion.</p>

   <h1><a name="8.How far away is the sun?">8.How far away is the sun?</a> </h1>
   <p>The sun is 93 million miles away from the earth. Even light, which travels so quickly that we cannot even see it move, takes
     eight minutes to get from the sun to earth.In a jet traveling 550 miles per hour, it wouldstill take 19 years to reach the sun.In a car traveling 60 mph, it would take about 177 years.This is one of those science questions that boggle even the adult mind!

   <h1><a name="9.How do flies walk on the ceiling?">9.How do flies walk on the ceiling?</a> </h1>
   <p>Flies can walk upside down! They can do this because of their sticky feet.A fly has foot pads that are covered in tacky glue.
    To unstick their feet so they can walk anywhere, the fly uses tiny foot claws to push or twist themselves away.Explore glues and polymers with a slime science kit for kids.</p>

   <p>Twitter’s made the list as it includes some nice personalization, easy to use search functionality, and it looks nice
    (something that few FAQ pages ever achieve).</p>
